# Store-Management-System

For this Python project, I decided to build a  Store Management Application that can be used for a variety of stores. 
It is a 3 tier application and was build and runs on the following:
 - 1 Front end: UI is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript + Bootstrap
 - 2 Backend: Python and Flask
 - 3 Database: MySql
